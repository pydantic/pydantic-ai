# Client

PydanticAI can act as an [MCP client](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/client), connecting to MCP servers
to use their tools.

## Install

You need to either install [`pydantic-ai`](../install.md), or[`pydantic-ai-slim`](../install.md#slim-install) with the `mcp` optional group:

```bash
pip/uv-add "pydantic-ai-slim[mcp]"
```

!!! note
    MCP integration requires Python 3.10 or higher.

## Usage

PydanticAI comes with two ways to connect to MCP servers:

- [`MCPServerHTTP`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPServerHTTP] which connects to an MCP server using the [HTTP SSE](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse) transport
- [`MCPServerStdio`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPServerStdio] which runs the server as a subprocess and connects to it using the [stdio](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio) transport

Examples of both are shown below; [mcp-run-python](run-python.md) is used as the MCP server in both examples.

### SSE Client

[`MCPServerHTTP`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPServerHTTP] connects over HTTP using the [HTTP + Server Sent Events transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#http-with-sse) to a server.

!!! note
    [`MCPServerHTTP`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPServerHTTP] requires an MCP server to be running and accepting HTTP connections before calling [`agent.run_mcp_servers()`][pydantic_ai.Agent.run_mcp_servers]. Running the server is not managed by PydanticAI.

The name "HTTP" is used since this implemented will be adapted in future to use the new
[Streamable HTTP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/specification/pull/206) currently in development.

Before creating the SSE client, we need to run the server (docs [here](run-python.md)):

```bash {title="terminal (run sse server)"}
npx @pydantic/mcp-run-python sse
```

```python {title="mcp_sse_client.py" py="3.10"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerHTTP

server = MCPServerHTTP(url='http://localhost:3001/sse')  # (1)!
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', mcp_servers=[server])  # (2)!


async def main():
    async with agent.run_mcp_servers():  # (3)!
        result = await agent.run('How many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?')
    print(result.data)
    #> There are 9,208 days between January 1, 2000, and March 18, 2025.
```

1. Define the MCP server with the URL used to connect.
2. Create an agent with the MCP server attached.
3. Create a client session to connect to the server.

_(This example is complete, it can be run "as is" with Python 3.10+ â€” you'll need to add `asyncio.run(main())` to run `main`)_

**What's happening here?**

* The model is receiving the prompt "how many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?"
* The model decides "Oh, I've got this `run_python_code` tool, that will be a good way to answer this question", and writes some python code to calculate the answer.
* The model returns a tool call
* PydanticAI sends the tool call to the MCP server using the SSE transport
* The model is called again with the return value of running the code
* The model returns the final answer

You can visualise this clearly, and even see the code that's run by adding three lines of code to instrument the example with [logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs):

```python {title="mcp_sse_client_logfire.py" test="skip"}
import logfire

logfire.configure()
logfire.instrument_pydantic_ai()
```

Will display as follows:

### MCP "stdio" Server

The other transport offered by MCP is the [stdio transport](https://spec.modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2024-11-05/basic/transports/#stdio) where the server is run as a subprocess and communicates with the client over `stdin` and `stdout`. In this case, you'd use the [`MCPServerStdio`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPServerStdio] class.

!!! note
    When using [`MCPServerStdio`][pydantic_ai.mcp.MCPServerStdio] servers, the [`agent.run_mcp_servers()`][pydantic_ai.Agent.run_mcp_servers] context manager is responsible for starting and stopping the server.


```python {title="mcp_stdio_client.py" py="3.10"}
from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.mcp import MCPServerStdio

server = MCPServerStdio('npx', ['-y', '@pydantic/mcp-run-python', 'stdio'])
agent = Agent('openai:gpt-4o', mcp_servers=[server])


async def main():
    async with agent.run_mcp_servers():
        result = await agent.run('How many days between 2000-01-01 and 2025-03-18?')
    print(result.data)
    #> There are 9,208 days between January 1, 2000, and March 18, 2025.
```
