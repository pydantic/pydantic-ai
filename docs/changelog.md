# Upgrade Guide

PydanticAI is still pre-version 1, so breaking changes will occur, however:

- We try to minimize them as much as possible.
- We use minor version bumps to signify breaking changes.
- Wherever possible we deprecate old features so code continues to work with deprecation warnings when changing the public API.
- We intend to release V1 in summer 2025, and then follow strict semantic versioning, e.g. no intentional breaking changes except in minor or patch versions.

## Breaking Changes

!!! note
    Here's a filtered list of the breaking changes for each version to help you upgrade PydanticAI.

### v0.4.0 (2025-07-08)

See [#1799](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/1799) - Pydantic Evals `EvaluationReport` and `ReportCase` are now generic dataclasses instead of Pydantic models. If you were serializing them using `model_dump()`, you will now need to use the `EvaluationReportAdapter` and `ReportCaseAdapter` type adapters instead.

See [#1507](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/1507) - The `ToolDefinition` `description` argument is now optional and the order of positional arguments has changed from `name, description, parameters_json_schema, ...` to `name, parameters_json_schema, description, ...` to account for this.

### v0.3.0 (2025-06-18)

See [#1142](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/1142) — Adds support for thinking parts.

We now convert the thinking blocks (`"<think>..."</think>"`) in provider specific text parts to
PydanticAI `ThinkingPart`s. Also, as part of this release, we made the choice to not send back the
`ThinkingPart`s to the provider - the idea is to save costs on behalf of the user. In the future, we
intend to add a setting to customize this behavior.

### v0.2.0 (2025-05-12)

See [#1647](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/1647) — usage makes sense as part of `ModelResponse`, and could be really useful in "messages" (really a sequence of requests and response). In this PR:

* Adds `usage` to `ModelResponse` (field has a default factory of `Usage()` so it'll work to load data that doesn't have usage)
* changes the return type of `Model.request` to just `ModelResponse` instead of `tuple[ModelResponse, Usage]`


### v0.1.0 (2025-04-15)

See [#1248](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/1248) — the attribute/parameter name `result` was renamed to `output` in many places. Hopefully all changes keep a deprecated attribute or parameter with the old name, so you should get many deprecation warnings.

See [#1484](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic-ai/pull/1484) — `format_as_xml` was moved and made available to import from the package root, e.g. `from pydantic_ai import format_as_xml`.
