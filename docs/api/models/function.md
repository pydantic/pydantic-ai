# `pydantic_ai.models.function`

A model controlled by a local function.

[`FunctionModel`][pydantic_ai.models.function.FunctionModel] is similar to [`TestModel`][pydantic_ai.models.test.TestModel],
but allows greater control over the model's behavior.

Its primary use case is for more advanced unit testing than is possible with `TestModel`.
