# Vercel AI Data Stream Protocol

Pydantic AI natively supports the [Vercel AI Data Stream Protocol](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/ai-sdk-ui/stream-protocol#data-stream-protocol) to receive agent run input from, and stream events to, a [Vercel AI Elements](https://ai-sdk.dev/elements) frontend.

## Usage

The [`VercelAIAdapter`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter] class is responsible for transforming agent run input received from the frontend into arguments for [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../agents.md#running-agents), running the agent, and then transforming Pydantic AI events into Vercel AI events. The event stream transformation is handled by the [`VercelAIEventStream`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIEventStream] class, but you typically won't use this directly.

If you're using a Starlette-based web framework like FastAPI, you can use the [`VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request] class method from an endpoint function to directly handle a request and return a streaming response of Vercel AI events. This is demonstrated in the next section.

If you're using a web framework not based on Starlette (e.g. Django or Flask) or need fine-grained control over the input or output, you can create a `VercelAIAdapter` instance and directly use its methods. This is demonstrated in "Advanced Usage" section below.

### Usage with Starlette/FastAPI

Besides the request, [`VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request] takes the agent, the same optional arguments as [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../agents.md#running-agents), and an optional `on_complete` callback function that receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult] and can optionally yield additional Vercel AI events.

```py {title="dispatch_request.py"}
from fastapi import FastAPI
from starlette.requests import Request
from starlette.responses import Response

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai import VercelAIAdapter

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5')

app = FastAPI()

@app.post('/chat')
async def chat(request: Request) -> Response:
    return await VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request(request, agent=agent)
```

### Advanced Usage

If you're using a web framework not based on Starlette (e.g. Django or Flask) or need fine-grained control over the input or output, you can create a `VercelAIAdapter` instance and directly use its methods, which can be chained to accomplish the same thing as the `VercelAIAdapter.dispatch_request()` class method shown above:

1. The [`VercelAIAdapter.build_run_input()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.build_run_input] class method takes the request body as bytes and returns a Vercel AI [`RequestData`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.request_types.RequestData] run input object, which you can then pass to the [`VercelAIAdapter()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter] constructor along with the agent.
    - You can also use the [`VercelAIAdapter.from_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.from_request] class method to build an adapter directly from a Starlette/FastAPI request.
2. The [`VercelAIAdapter.run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.run_stream] method runs the agent and returns a stream of Vercel AI events. It supports the same optional arguments as [`Agent.run_stream_events()`](../agents.md#running-agents) and an optional `on_complete` callback function that receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult] and can optionally yield additional Vercel AI events.
    - You can also use [`VercelAIAdapter.run_stream_native()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.run_stream_native] to run the agent and return a stream of Pydantic AI events instead, which can then be transformed into Vercel AI events using [`VercelAIAdapter.transform_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.transform_stream].
3. The [`VercelAIAdapter.encode_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.encode_stream] method encodes the stream of Vercel AI events as SSE (HTTP Server-Sent Events) strings, which you can then return as a streaming response.
    - You can also use [`VercelAIAdapter.streaming_response()`][pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai.VercelAIAdapter.streaming_response] to generate a Starlette/FastAPI streaming response directly from the Vercel AI event stream returned by `run_stream()`.

!!! note
    This example uses FastAPI, but can be modified to work with any web framework.

```py {title="run_stream.py"}
import json
from http import HTTPStatus

from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.requests import Request
from fastapi.responses import Response, StreamingResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

from pydantic_ai import Agent
from pydantic_ai.ui import SSE_CONTENT_TYPE
from pydantic_ai.ui.vercel_ai import VercelAIAdapter

agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5')

app = FastAPI()


@app.post('/chat')
async def chat(request: Request) -> Response:
    accept = request.headers.get('accept', SSE_CONTENT_TYPE)
    try:
        run_input = VercelAIAdapter.build_run_input(await request.body())
    except ValidationError as e:
        return Response(
            content=json.dumps(e.json()),
            media_type='application/json',
            status_code=HTTPStatus.UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY,
        )

    adapter = VercelAIAdapter(agent=agent, run_input=run_input, accept=accept)
    event_stream = adapter.run_stream()

    sse_event_stream = adapter.encode_stream(event_stream)
    return StreamingResponse(sse_event_stream, media_type=accept)
```
