# Shared runtime + engine config for the Pydantic AI gh-aw shim (MiniMax backend).
#
# Registers as the built-in `claude` engine and only overrides `command`, so
# gh-aw runs its full Claude proxy + credential-injection machinery.
#
# ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL MUST be a compile-time literal (not a ${{ vars.* }}
# expression): gh-aw derives the api-proxy target host AND the
# `--anthropic-api-base-path` from its parsed URL path at compile time. With a
# vars expression the path can't be parsed, so the proxy drops the `/anthropic`
# prefix and the upstream returns 404. Only ANTHROPIC_API_KEY stays a secret
# (injected by the AWF api-proxy, excluded from the agent container).
# MiniMax exposes an Anthropic-compatible API at https://api.minimax.io/anthropic.
#
# The checked-out workspace is mounted no-exec in the AWF sandbox, so a
# pre-step stages a launcher in gh-aw's exec-able /tmp/gh-aw/bin that runs
# `uv run --script` against the workspace harness.
#
# Required repo variable:
#   GH_AW_MODEL — model name forwarded as `--model <name>` to the harness.
# Required secret:
#   MINIMAX_API_KEY — API key injected by the AWF api-proxy.
#
# Usage:
#   imports:
#     - shared/engine-minimax.md
