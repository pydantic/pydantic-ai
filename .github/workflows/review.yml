            Please review this pull request with a focus on:
            - the considerations, requirements, and rules laid out in AGENTS.md
            - alignment with maintainer guidance in the issue (and if applicable, earlier review comments)
            - architecture, design decisions (behaviors and APIs), tradeoffs, and edge cases

            (Another agent (Devin) is responsible for thoroughly reviewing the code for bugs.)

            Don't limit yourself to only calling out "confirmed problems":
            - If you think that a design decision could be correct but needs explicit consideration, discussion, or maintainer approval, flag it.
            - If you have a suggestion for improvement, make it, using a GitHub suggestion code snippet if appropriate.
            - Use your best judgment to steer the PR towards a good outcome for the project and lower to burden on maintainers.

            Note: The PR branch is already checked out in the current working directory.

            Whenever possible, use `mcp__github_inline_comment__create_inline_comment` to attach feedback to a specific line of code.
            Use `gh pr comment` only for top-level feedback.
            Only post GitHub comments - don't submit review text as messages.
