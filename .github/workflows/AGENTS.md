# Agentic workflows (`gh-aw`)

The `pydantic-ai-*` workflows in this directory are [agentic workflows](https://github.com/githubnext/gh-aw) authored as human-editable `<name>.md` sources (frontmatter + prompt) that **compile** to a generated `<name>.lock.yml`. GitHub Actions runs the `.lock.yml`, never the `.md`.

- **Never hand-edit a `*.lock.yml`.** It is generated — the header says so. Manual edits are silently overwritten on the next recompile, and until then the running workflow diverges from its source.
- **After editing a workflow `*.md` source, recompile and commit the regenerated `*.lock.yml` in the same change** — a `*.md` edit without its recompiled lock is incomplete, and source and lock drift apart:

  ```
  gh aw compile
  ```

- **Recompilation is required for anything the lock bakes in:** a source's frontmatter (`on:` triggers, `permissions`, `tools`, `safe-outputs`, jobs, path/`detect` filters) and its `imports:` shared fragments (`shared/*.md`) are inlined into the lock at compile time.
- **Exception — runtime-resolved prompts need no recompile.** Agent prompts under `shared/prompts/` are fetched at run time (via the `fetch-dynamic-prompt` action / a Logfire-managed variable), not baked into the lock, so editing one takes effect on the next run without recompiling.
