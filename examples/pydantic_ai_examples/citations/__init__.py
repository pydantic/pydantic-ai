"""Citation examples for different providers.

Examples showing how to access citations from model responses across
different providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Perplexity, OpenRouter).

Note: Citations are only available when the model includes them in its response.
Availability depends on the model's capabilities, query type, and provider-specific
settings (e.g., enabling web search for Google).
