        """An ASGI application that handles every request by running the agent and streaming the response.

        Note that the `deps` will be the same for each request, with the exception of the frontend state that's
        injected into the `state` field of a `deps` object that implements the [`StateHandler`][pydantic_ai.ui.StateHandler] protocol.
        To provide different `deps` for each request (e.g. based on the authenticated user),
        use [`AGUIAdapter.run_stream()`][pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter.run_stream] or
        [`AGUIAdapter.dispatch_request()`][pydantic_ai.ui.ag_ui.AGUIAdapter.dispatch_request] instead.

        Args:
            agent: The agent to run.

            output_type: Custom output type to use for this run, `output_type` may only be used if the agent has
                no output validators since output validators would expect an argument that matches the agent's
                output type.
            message_history: History of the conversation so far.
            deferred_tool_results: Optional results for deferred tool calls in the message history.
            model: Optional model to use for this run, required if `model` was not set when creating the agent.
            deps: Optional dependencies to use for this run.
            model_settings: Optional settings to use for this model's request.
            usage_limits: Optional limits on model request count or token usage.
            usage: Optional usage to start with, useful for resuming a conversation or agents used in tools.
            infer_name: Whether to try to infer the agent name from the call frame if it's not set.
            toolsets: Optional additional toolsets for this run.
            builtin_tools: Optional additional builtin tools for this run.
            on_complete: Optional callback function called when the agent run completes successfully.
                The callback receives the completed [`AgentRunResult`][pydantic_ai.agent.AgentRunResult] and can access `all_messages()` and other result data.

            debug: Boolean indicating if debug tracebacks should be returned on errors.
            routes: A list of routes to serve incoming HTTP and WebSocket requests.
            middleware: A list of middleware to run for every request. A starlette application will always
                automatically include two middleware classes. `ServerErrorMiddleware` is added as the very
                outermost middleware, to handle any uncaught errors occurring anywhere in the entire stack.
                `ExceptionMiddleware` is added as the very innermost middleware, to deal with handled
                exception cases occurring in the routing or endpoints.
            exception_handlers: A mapping of either integer status codes, or exception class types onto
                callables which handle the exceptions. Exception handler callables should be of the form
                `handler(request, exc) -> response` and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_startup: A list of callables to run on application startup. Startup handler callables do not
                take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            on_shutdown: A list of callables to run on application shutdown. Shutdown handler callables do
                not take any arguments, and may be either standard functions, or async functions.
            lifespan: A lifespan context function, which can be used to perform startup and shutdown tasks.
                This is a newer style that replaces the `on_startup` and `on_shutdown` handlers. Use one or
                the other, not both.
