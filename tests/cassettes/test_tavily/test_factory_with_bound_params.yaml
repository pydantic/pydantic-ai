          is an important mechanism that can be employed for a variety of deep learning models across many different domains
          and tasks. The various attention mechanisms are explained by means of a framework consisting of a general attention
          model, uniform notation, and a comprehensive taxonomy of attention mechanisms. | Subjects: | Machine Learning (cs.LG)
