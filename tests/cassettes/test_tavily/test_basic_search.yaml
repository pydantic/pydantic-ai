          framework specifically designed to simplify the creation of production-grade AI agents. **Pydantic AI** is a Python
          framework that acts as a bridge between developers and LLMs, providing tools to create **agents** -- entities that
          execute specific tasks based on system prompts, functions, and structured outputs. Here''s a basic example of using
          Pydantic AI to create an agent that responds to user queries:. from pydantic_ai import Agentagent = Agent("openai:gpt-4",
          system_prompt="Be a helpful assistant.")result = await agent.run("Hello, how are you?")print(result.data) # Outputs
          the response. from pydantic_ai import ModelRetry@agent.tooldef validate_data(ctx): if not ctx.input_data: raise
          ModelRetry("Data missing, retrying..."). Pydantic AI is transforming how developers build AI agents. Install Pydantic
          AI today and build your first agent!**. ### Agent Framework / shim to use Pydantic with LLMs. Contribute to pydantic/pydantic-ai

      - content: '*"Pydantic AI is a Python agent framework designed to help you quickly, confidently, and painlessly build
          production grade applications and workflows with Generative AI."*. So they built Pydantic AI with a single, simple
          aim, to bring that FastAPI feeling to building applications and workflows with generative AI. A: Pydantic AI is
          a Python agent framework from the creators of Pydantic Validation. Q: How is Pydantic AI different from other agent
          frameworks like LangChain or LlamaIndex? Q: What LLM providers does Pydantic AI support? Q: Can I use my own custom
          models with Pydantic AI? Q: Can I use Pydantic AI with existing FastAPI applications? A: Yes, Pydantic AI is designed
          to integrate well with FastAPI and other Python web frameworks. A: Pydantic AI uses Pydantic models to define structured
          output types, ensuring LLM responses are validated and type-safe. A: Yes, Pydantic AI is designed specifically for
          production-grade applications with features like durable execution, observability integration, and type safety.'
