          scores across multiple items. Consistency and\nobjectivity are critical for reliable rankings. Each comparison should
          be independent but internally consistent.\n\n<EXAMPLES>\nExample 1:\n<QUESTION> Which of the two ice cream flavours

          Consider the question carefully. What aspects are important for the answer?\n2. Think about answer A. Is it a good
          answer to the question? Why (not)?\n3. Think about answer B. Is it a good answer to the question? Why (not)?\n4.
