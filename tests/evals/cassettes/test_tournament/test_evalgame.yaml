          scores across multiple items. Consistency and\nobjectivity are critical for reliable rankings. Each comparison should
          be independent but internally consistent.\n\n<EXAMPLES>\nExample 1:\n<QUESTION> Which of the two ice cream flavours
          below is more creative? </QUESTION>\n<A> Vanilla </A> \n<B> Pickled Citrus Ribbon </B>\nExpected output:\n{\n    \"result\":

          ocean acidification feedback loops on Arctic methane release </A> \n<B> climate change effects </B>\nExpected output:\n{\n

          Consider the question carefully. What aspects are important for the answer?\n2. Think about answer A. Is it a good
          answer to the question? Why (not)?\n3. Think about answer B. Is it a good answer to the question? Why (not)?\n4.
          Make a decision based on your analysis.\n</REQUIREMENTS>\n\n<OUTPUT_FORMAT>\nYou must respond with valid JSON containing
