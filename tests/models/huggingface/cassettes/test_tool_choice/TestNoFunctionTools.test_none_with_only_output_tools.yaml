                Massachusetts in the United States. Boston is also the seat of Suffolk County, although the county government
                was disbanded on July 1, 1997. The city proper covers 48.4 square miles (125.4 km²), with an adjacent inner
                harbor. Boston is one of the oldest municipalities in the United States, founded on the Shawmut Peninsula
                in 1630 by Puritan settlers. It was named after Boston, Lincolnshire, England; the area was called Trimountain
                by the local Tawahe Indigenous people."}'
