            Berlin! As a virtual assistant, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions. However, I can suggest a few ways for you to find out the current weather in Berlin:

            1. **Check a weather website or app**: You can visit websites like AccuWeather, Weather.com, or Deutsche Wetterdienst (DWD) to get the current weather conditions and forecast for Berlin.
            2. **Use a search engine**: Simply type "Berlin weather" or "weather Berlin" in a search engine like Google, and you'll get the current weather conditions and forecast.
            3. **Check a weather service**: You can also check services like Dark Sky (for iOS or Android) or Weather Underground (for iOS or Android) for hyperlocal weather forecasts.

            That being said, Berlin has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. Here's a rough idea of what you can expect:

            * **Spring (March to May)**: Mild temperatures (around 10-20°C/50-68°F) with occasional rain showers.
            * **Summer (June to August)**: Warm temperatures (around 20-25°C/68-77°F) with occasional heatwaves.
            * **Autumn (September to November)**: Cooler temperatures (around 10-15°C/50-59°F) with some rain.
            * **Winter (December to February)**: Cold temperatures (around 0-5°C/32-41°F) with occasional snowfall.

            Keep in mind that these are general temperature ranges, and actual weather conditions can vary from year to year.

            If you have a specific question about Berlin's weather or need more information, feel free to ask!
