            I'm not able to provide real-time information, but I can suggest some ways for you to find out the current weather in Berlin:

            1. Check a weather website or app: You can check websites like weather.com, accuweather.com, or wunderground.com for current weather conditions and forecasts in Berlin.
            2. Use a search engine: Simply type "Berlin weather" or "weather in Berlin" into a search engine like Google, and you'll get the current weather conditions and forecast.
            3. Check a weather service: You can also check the website of a national weather service, such as the German Weather Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst) or the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).

            As of my knowledge cutoff, Berlin has a temperate climate with four distinct seasons. The city experiences cold winters, with average temperatures ranging from -2°C to 2°C (28°F to 36°F) in January, the coldest month. Summers are mild, with average temperatures ranging from 18°C to 23°C (64°F to 73°F) in July, the warmest month.

            Please note that weather conditions can change quickly, so it's always a good idea to check a reliable weather source for the most up-to-date information.
