            Rome! The Eternal City!

            I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions. However, I can suggest some ways for you to find out the current weather in Rome:

            1. **Check a weather website or app**: You can visit websites like AccuWeather, Weather.com, or Rome's official website to get the current weather conditions and forecast.
            2. **Use a weather API**: If you're looking for a more programmatic way to get the weather, you can use a weather API like OpenWeatherMap or Dark Sky.
            3. **Ask a voice assistant**: If you have a voice assistant like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa, you can ask them "What's the weather in Rome?" and they'll provide you with the current conditions.

            That being said, Rome has a Mediterranean climate with warm summers and mild winters. Here's a general idea of what you can expect:

            * **Summer (June to August)**: Hot and dry, with average highs around 32°C (90°F) and lows around 18°C (64°F).
            * **Autumn (September to November)**: Mild and pleasant, with average highs around 22°C (72°F) and lows around 12°C (54°F).
            * **Winter (December to February)**: Cool and wet, with average highs around 12°C (54°F) and lows around 2°C (36°F).
            * **Spring (March to May)**: Mild and sunny, with average highs around 20°C (68°F) and lows around 10°C (50°F).

            Keep in mind that these are general temperature ranges, and actual weather conditions can vary from year to year.

            Hope this helps!
