            I don't have access to live weather data right now, so I can't give the current conditions in Berlin. I can:

            - Give a quick summary of Berlin's typical climate, or
            - Tell you where to get an up-to-date forecast (websites/apps and tips), or
            - Interpret a forecast you paste here, or
            - Provide a likely estimate for a specific date based on seasonal norms.

            Quick climate summary (typical conditions):
            - Climate type: temperate (between oceanic and continental).
            - Summer (Jun-Aug): warm -- average highs ~23-25°C, nighttime lows ~13-15°C; occasional hot spells above 30°C.
            - Autumn (Sep-Nov): cooling; rain increases, temperatures fall from ~18°C in September to single digits by November.
            - Winter (Dec-Feb): cold -- average highs around 0-4°C, lows often below freezing; snow is possible but not always heavy.
            - Spring (Mar-May): variable -- can be cool early, warming to pleasant by May.
            - Precipitation: moderate year-round, with slightly drier late winter/early spring and wetter summer thunderstorms possible.

            Where to check current weather:
            - Official German service: Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) website or app.
            - Popular options: Weather.com, AccuWeather, MeteoGroup (WeatherPro), BBC Weather, or your phone's built‐in weather app.
            - For very local detail: search "Berlin weather" in a search engine for hourly forecasts, radar, and alerts.

            Which would you like me to do next? (e.g., give a forecast estimate for a specific date, or walk you through checking the live forecast.)
