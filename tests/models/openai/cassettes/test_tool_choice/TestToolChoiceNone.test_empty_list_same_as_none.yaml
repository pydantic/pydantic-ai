            I can’t fetch live weather data right now. I can help in other ways — for example I can tell you how to check current conditions, give a typical climate summary for this time of year, or give packing/clothing advice.

            Quick options:
            - To get the current weather now: check a phone weather app or a weather website (e.g., Weather.com, AccuWeather, or a local Italian weather site), or search “Rome weather” in your browser. You can also check METAR/TAF reports for Rome Fiumicino (if you want aviation-style observations).
            - Typical conditions for Rome in mid-December: average daytime high about 12–14°C (54–57°F), nighttime low about 3–6°C (37–43°F). December is one of Rome’s wetter months — expect a fair chance of rain and generally mild but cool temperatures; occasional chilly days or brief cold snaps are possible.
            - If you tell me a specific date/time or what you’re planning to do (walking around, sightseeing, evening out), I can give tailored clothing and activity advice based on typical conditions.
