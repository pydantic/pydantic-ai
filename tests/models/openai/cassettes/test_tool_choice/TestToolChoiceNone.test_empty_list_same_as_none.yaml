            I can't access live real‐time weather data right now, so I can't give the current conditions for Rome. I can, however:

            - Give typical/climatological conditions for this time of year (December): average highs about 12-14°C (54-57°F), lows around 4-7°C (39-45°F), with occasional rain -- cool and often damp, so a warm coat and umbrella are useful.
            - Suggest how to get the current weather quickly: open your phone's weather app or search "Rome weather" in Google, or check sites/apps like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or the Italian service (Meteo.it).
            - If you want, I can provide a 7‐day climatological expectation for Rome, packing/clothing advice for travel, or explain how to interpret forecasts (temperature, precipitation probability, wind).

            Which would you like me to do?
