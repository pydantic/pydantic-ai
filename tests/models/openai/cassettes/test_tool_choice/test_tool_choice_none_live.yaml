          content: "I can’t fetch live weather data right now (I don’t have access to the live-data tool at the moment). I
            can, however, give you a quick summary of what Paris is typically like at this time of year and some ways to check
            the current conditions.\n\nTypical conditions for Paris in early December:\n- Temperatures: roughly 3–10°C (37–50°F)
            — nights near freezing, daytime cool.  \n- Sky: often cloudy or overcast.  \n- Precipitation: light rain or drizzle
            is common.  \n- Wind: usually mild to moderate.  \n- Daylight: short days; evenings get dark early.\n\nHow to
            get the current, live weather right now:\n- Check a weather website or app (Météo‑France, BBC Weather, Weather.com,
            or your phone’s weather app).  \n- Ask a smart assistant on your phone/speaker (Siri, Google Assistant, Alexa).
            \ \n- If you want, I can fetch the current conditions and forecast once live-data access is available — or I can
            show you step‑by‑step how to check on a specific site or app.\n\nDo you want clothing/recommendation (what to
            pack or wear today) based on the typical conditions, or would you like instructions for checking a live forecast
            on a particular site or app?"
