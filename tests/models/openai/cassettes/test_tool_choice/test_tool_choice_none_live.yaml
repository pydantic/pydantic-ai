            I can’t fetch live weather right now, but I can tell you what to expect in Paris this time of year and how to check the current conditions.

            Typical Paris weather mid‑December
            - Temperatures: daytime highs around 5–9°C (41–48°F), nighttime lows around 0–4°C (32–39°F). Occasional cold snaps can dip below freezing.
            - Precipitation: often overcast with frequent rain or drizzle; light snow is possible but not common.
            - Wind: generally light to moderate; wind can make it feel colder.
            - Daylight: short days (sunrise late, sunset early).

            Practical tips
            - Bring a warm, waterproof coat or a rainproof layer, umbrella, and comfortable waterproof shoes.
            - Dress in layers (sweater + light insulating layer) and pack a hat/scarf/gloves for colder evenings.
            - For walking/touring, plan some indoor activities (museums, cafés) in case of rain.

            How to get the current, live forecast
            - Check Météo‑France, Weather.com, BBC Weather, or your phone’s weather app.
            - Quick command (if you use a terminal): curl wttr.in/Paris
            - Search “Paris weather” in Google for hourly and 10-day forecasts.

            If you’d like, tell me a specific date or range and I’ll give typical conditions and packing/activity recommendations — or paste a current forecast and I’ll help interpret it.
