            I'd love to help! However, I'm a large language model, I don't have real-time access to current weather conditions. But I can suggest a few options to help you find out the current weather in Berlin:

            1. **Check a weather website or app**: You can visit websites like weather.com, accuweather.com, or wunderground.com, or download apps like Dark Sky or Weather Underground to get the current weather conditions in Berlin.
            2. **Use a search engine**: Simply type "Berlin weather" or "weather in Berlin" in a search engine like Google, and you'll get the current weather conditions along with a forecast.
            3. **Check a local news website**: You can also visit a local news website from Berlin, such as the Berlin-based newspaper "Tagesspiegel" or "Berliner Zeitung", which often have up-to-date weather forecasts.

            As of my knowledge cutoff in 2022, Berlin's climate is generally temperate, with warm summers and cold winters. But for the most accurate and up-to-date information, I recommend checking one of the sources mentioned above.
