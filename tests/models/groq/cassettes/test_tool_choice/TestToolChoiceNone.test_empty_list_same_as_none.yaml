          content: "Rome has a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Here's a general
            overview of the weather in Rome:\n\n**Current Weather:** \nTo give you the most up-to-date information, I'd recommend
            checking a reliable weather website or app, such as AccuWeather, Weather.com, or the Italian Meteorological Society
            (it might be in Italian). \n\nHowever, I can tell you that Rome's current weather can be checked through various
            online platforms.\n\n**Seasonal Weather Patterns:**\n\n* **Spring (March to May)**: Mild temperatures, ranging
            from 12°C (54°F) to 22°C (72°F), with occasional rain showers.\n* **Summer (June to August)**: Hot and dry, with
            temperatures often reaching 30°C (86°F) or more, sometimes up to 35°C (95°F) or 40°C (104°F) during heatwaves.\n*
            **Autumn (September to November)**: Comfortable temperatures, ranging from 10°C (50°F) to 25°C (77°F), with some
            rain.\n* **Winter (December to February)**: Cool and wet, with temperatures ranging from 2°C (36°F) to 12°C (54°F).\n\n**Monthly
            Average Weather:**\n\nHere's a rough idea of what to expect:\n\n* January: 8°C (46°F) / 12°C (54°F)\n* February:
            9°C (48°F) / 13°C (56°F)\n* March: 12°C (54°F) / 17°C (63°F)\n* April: 15°C (59°F) / 20°C (68°F)\n* May: 19°C
            (66°F) / 24°C (75°F)\n* June: 23°C (73°F) / 28°C (82°F)\n* July: 26°C (79°F) / 31°C (88°F)\n* August: 26°C (79°F)
            / 31°C (88°F)\n* September: 22°C (72°F) / 27°C (81°F)\n* October: 18°C (64°F) / 23°C (73°F)\n* November: 14°C
            (57°F) / 18°C (64°F)\n* December: 10°C (50°F) / 14°C (57°F)\n\nKeep in mind that these are general temperature
            ranges, and actual weather conditions can vary from year to year.\n\nIf you're planning a trip to Rome, I recommend
            checking the weather forecast before your visit to ensure you're prepared for any conditions."
