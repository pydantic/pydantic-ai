              The Eiffel Tower is a famous landmark located in Paris, the capital of France. It is one of the most recognizable structures in the world.

              Here are some key facts about the Eiffel Tower:

              *   **Construction:** It was designed by the engineer Gustave Eiffel, and his company built it between 1887 and 1889. It was created as the entrance arch for the 1889 Exposition Universelle (World's Fair), which celebrated the 100th anniversary of the French Revolution.
              *   **Design and Material:** The tower is made of wrought iron and is a masterpiece of structural engineering. Its open-lattice design was innovative for its time and was chosen for its wind resistance and stability.
              *   **Height:** The Eiffel Tower stands at a height of 330 meters (1,083 feet), including its antennas. For about 41 years, it held the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world until the Chrysler Building in New York City was completed in 1930.
              *   **Visiting:** The tower has three levels for visitors. The first two levels can be reached by stairs or elevators and feature restaurants and shops. The top level, accessible only by elevator, offers panoramic views of Paris.
              *   **Cultural Impact:** Initially criticized by some of France's leading artists and intellectuals for its design, the Eiffel Tower has since become a global cultural icon of France and a symbol of Paris itself. It is one of the most visited paid monuments in the world.
