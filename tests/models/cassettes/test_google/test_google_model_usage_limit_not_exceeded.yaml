              That's a classic! "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" is one of the most famous **pangrams**.

              A pangram is a sentence that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once. It's widely used for:
              *   **Typing practice:** To ensure you hit every key.
              *   **Displaying typefaces (fonts):** To show how all the letters look in a particular font.
              *   **Testing equipment:** Like typewriters or keyboards.

              It's quite efficient for that purpose, using only 35 letters (if "lazy dog" is treated as two words, which is more common). You even combined "lazy dog" into "lazydog" which is often done to make it even shorter or for specific software testing!
