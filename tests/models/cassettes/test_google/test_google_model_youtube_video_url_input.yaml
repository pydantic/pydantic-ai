              asks the agent, "Logfire," to identify patterns in these errors. The agent then queries a Logfire database,
              extracts relevant information like URL paths, HTTP methods, and timestamps, and presents a detailed analysis
              covering common error-prone endpoints, request patterns, timeline-related issues, and potential configuration
              or authentication problems. Finally, it offers a list of actionable recommendations to address these issues.
