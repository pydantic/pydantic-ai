              **Calculating the Simple**

              Okay, here we go. Someone's asking a pretty straightforward arithmetic question. It's really just a simple calculation. Nothing fancy, just plug in the numbers and get the result.  No need to overthink it. It's a quick win, a chance to flex some basic math muscles before getting into anything more complex. Just a matter of applying the right operation and moving on.
