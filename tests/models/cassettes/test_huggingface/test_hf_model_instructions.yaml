          content: "<think>\nOkay, the user is asking about the capital of France. That's a straightforward geography question.
            \n\nHmm, I recall that Paris is the capital--it's one of those basic facts everyone learns in school. The user
            might be a student doing homework, a traveler planning a trip, or just someone confirming a trivia detail. Since
            the question is simple, they probably want a quick, clear answer without extra fluff. \n\nBut wait--should I add
            more context? Like how Paris is also France's cultural and economic hub? Nah, the query doesn't hint at needing
            depth. Over-explaining might annoy them. Keep it concise: \"Paris\" plus a tiny assurance (\"That's correct!\")
            to sound friendly. \n\n...Though if they follow up, I could mention the Seine River or the Eiffel Tower. For now,
            brevity wins.\n</think>\nThe capital of France is **Paris**.  \n\nThat's correct! Paris is not only the political
            center but also the cultural, economic, and historical heart of France. \U0001F1EB\U0001F1F7"
