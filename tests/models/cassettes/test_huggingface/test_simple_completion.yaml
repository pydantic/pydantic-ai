        message:
          content: "<think>\nHmm, the user just said \"hello\". That's a simple greeting, but I need to figure out how to
            respond appropriately.  \n\nFirst, I should acknowledge their greeting warmly since starting friendly sets a positive
            tone. Maybe \"Hello!\" with an exclamation to show enthusiasm.  \n\nI wonder if this is just a test message or
            if they have something specific in mind. The message is very short, so they might be:  \n- Checking if I'm active
            \ \n- Unsure how to start  \n- Or just being polite before asking something else  \n\nSince they didn't follow
            up immediately, I'll keep it open-ended. Adding \"How can I help you today?\" invites them to share their actual
            need without pressure.  \n\nAlso, no emojis yet--they didn't use any, so I'll match that tone unless they show
            preference later. Keeping it simple but friendly feels right here.\n</think>\nHello! \U0001F44B How can I help
            you today?"
