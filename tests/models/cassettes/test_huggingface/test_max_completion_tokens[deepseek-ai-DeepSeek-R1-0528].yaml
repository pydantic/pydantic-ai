            \ They might be testing if I'm online, starting a casual chat, or preparing\
            \ a deeper question.  \n\nSince they didn't add context, I'll match their\
            \ tone—friendly and open-ended. Short response invites them to lead. Adding\
            \ the emoji makes it warmer. No need to overthink yet. \n\nHmm… if they're\
            \ new, they might need reassurance that I'm responsive. If they're regular\
            \ users, they're probably just warming up. Either way, keeping it light\
            \ feels safe. \n\nWatch for clues in their next message—if they dive into\
            \ a topic, they were just being polite before asking. If they reply with\
            \ small talk, they might want companionship.\n</think>\nHello! \U0001F60A\
