        message:
          content: "<think>\nHmm, the user just said \"hello\". That's a simple greeting, but I need to figure out how to
            respond appropriately. \n\nFirst, I should acknowledge their greeting warmly since starting with a friendly tone
            sets a positive interaction. The user might be testing if I'm responsive, or they could be preparing to ask something
            more complex. \n\nI notice they didn't provide any context - no name, no question, just a bare greeting. That
            makes me think either: \n- They're new to chatting with AIs and testing the waters \n- They're distracted or typing
            slowly \n- Or they expect me to take initiative in the conversation \n\nGiven that, my response should be open-ended
            to encourage them to share their needs. Adding a smiley face \U0001F60A makes it feel more human and approachable.
            \n\nI'll keep it simple but inviting - \"Hello! How can I help you today?\" covers all bases: acknowledges them,
            shows readiness, and leaves the door open for anything from casual chat to serious requests. \n\nNo need to overthink
            this one - short and warm is perfect here.\n</think>\nHello! \U0001F60A How can I help you today?"
