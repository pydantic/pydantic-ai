          Here's how to cross the street safely:

          ## Basic Steps

          1. **Find a safe crossing point**
             - Use crosswalks, intersections, or pedestrian signals when available
             - Avoid crossing between parked cars or on curves

          2. **Stop at the curb/edge**
             - Don't step into the street yet

          3. **Look all directions**
             - Look left, then right, then left again
             - Keep looking while you cross

          4. **Listen for traffic**
             - Remove headphones or lower volume
             - Listen for engines, horns, or sirens

          5. **Wait for a safe gap**
             - Make sure cars have stopped or are far enough away
             - Make eye contact with drivers if possible

          6. **Cross steadily**
             - Walk, don't run (unless necessary)
             - Stay alert and keep watching for cars
             - Stay in the crosswalk if there is one

          ## At Traffic Signals
          - Press the pedestrian button if there is one
          - Wait for the "WALK" signal
          - Still look both ways even with a walk signal
          - Don't start crossing on a flashing "DON'T WALK"

          **Key point**: Always assume drivers may not see you, so stay alert and make safe choices.

          This is an interesting analogy question. The person is asking me to apply the safety principles and general approach from crossing a street to crossing a river. Let me think about the parallel elements:

          Street crossing principles:
          - Find safe crossing point
          - Assess conditions
          - Look for hazards
          - Use designated crossings when available
          - Wait for safe conditions
          - Cross carefully while staying alert

          River crossing would involve similar safety thinking:
          - Find safe crossing point (bridge, ford, ferry, shallow area)
          - Assess conditions (water depth, current, weather)
          - Look for hazards (rocks, debris, cold water, strong current)
          - Use established crossings when available
          - Wait for safe conditions (water levels, weather)
          - Cross carefully while staying alert

          I should provide practical advice for different methods of crossing a river.

          # How to Cross a River (Using the Street-Crossing Analogy)

          ## Find a Safe Crossing Point
          **Like using crosswalks**, look for:
          - **Bridges** (the safest "crosswalk")
          - **Ferries or boats** (designated crossing)
          - **Fords** - marked shallow crossing points
          - **Stepping stones** in shallow areas

          ## Stop and Assess Conditions
          **Like stopping at the curb**, evaluate:
          - Water depth and current speed
          - Weather conditions
          - Water temperature
          - Your swimming ability and fitness
          - Distance to the other side

          ## Look for Hazards
          **Like looking both ways for cars**, check for:
          - Strong currents or rapids
          - Hidden rocks or drop-offs
          - Debris in the water
          - Slippery banks
          - Cold water (hypothermia risk)

          ## Wait for Safe Conditions
          **Like waiting for traffic to clear**:
          - Don't cross during floods or after heavy rain
          - Avoid crossing in bad weather
          - Consider water levels (seasonal changes)

          ## Cross Carefully
          **Like walking across steadily**:
          - Use bridges when available (safest option)
          - If wading: use a stick for balance, face upstream, shuffle sideways
          - Never cross alone if conditions are uncertain
          - Wear a life jacket if available

          **Key point**: Just as you wouldn't jaywalk across a highway, **don't attempt to cross dangerous rivers**. When in doubt, find a bridge or don't cross.
