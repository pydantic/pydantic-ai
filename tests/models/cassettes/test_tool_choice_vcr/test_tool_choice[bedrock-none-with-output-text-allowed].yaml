                summary: Paris is the capital and largest city of France, known as the "City of Light." It's a global center
                  for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture, home to iconic landmarks like the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum,
                  Notre-Dame Cathedral, and Arc de Triomphe. With a population of over 2 million in the city proper and 12
                  million in the metropolitan area, Paris sits along the Seine River and is divided into 20 districts called
                  arrondissements. The city has been a major influence on Western civilization for centuries and remains one
                  of the world's most visited tourist destinations.
