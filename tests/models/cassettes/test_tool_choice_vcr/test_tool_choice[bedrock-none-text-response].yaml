              I don't have access to real-time weather information. I can't browse the internet or access current data.

              To find the current weather in Paris, you could:
              - Check weather websites like weather.com or accuweather.com
              - Search "Paris weather" on Google
              - Use a weather app on your phone
              - Ask a voice assistant with internet access like Siri or Google Assistant

              Is there anything else I can help you with?
