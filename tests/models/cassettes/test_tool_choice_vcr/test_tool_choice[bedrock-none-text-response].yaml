              I don't have access to real-time weather data or the ability to browse the internet, so I can't tell you the current weather in Paris.

              To get current weather information for Paris, you could:

              1. **Search online** - Google "Paris weather" for instant results
              2. **Use weather websites** - Check sites like Weather.com, AccuWeather, or Weather Underground
              3. **Use weather apps** - Try apps like Weather Channel, AccuWeather, or your phone's built-in weather app
              4. **Ask a voice assistant** - Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa can provide current conditions

              Is there anything else about Paris I can help you with that doesn't require real-time data?
