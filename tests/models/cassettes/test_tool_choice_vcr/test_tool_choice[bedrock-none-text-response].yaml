              I don't have access to real-time weather data or the ability to browse the internet, so I can't tell you the current weather in Paris.

              To get current weather information for Paris, you can:
              - Check weather websites like weather.com or accuweather.com
              - Search "Paris weather" on Google
              - Use weather apps on your phone
              - Visit meteorological services like Météo-France

              Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Paris?
