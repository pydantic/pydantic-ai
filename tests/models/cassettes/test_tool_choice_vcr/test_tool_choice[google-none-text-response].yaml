              I cannot provide real-time, current weather updates as an AI. My knowledge cutoff means I don't have access to live data.

              To get the most accurate and up-to-date weather in Paris, I recommend checking a reliable weather source like:

              *   **Google Weather:** Just search "weather in Paris"
              *   **A weather app:** Such as AccuWeather, The Weather Channel, or your phone's built-in weather app
              *   **A weather website:** Like Météo-France (for local details) or other international weather sites.
