                in north-central France. It is one of the world''s major cultural, financial, and political centers, famous
                for landmarks such as the Eiffel Tower, the Louvre Museum, Notre-Dame Cathedral, the Champs-Élysées, and Montmartre.
                The city has roughly 2.1 million residents in the city proper and about 12 million in the wider metropolitan
                area, and is organized into 20 arrondissements. Paris is renowned for its art, fashion, gastronomy, historic
                architecture, and vibrant café culture. Major transport hubs include Charles de Gaulle and Orly airports,
                an extensive Métro and RER network, and high-speed TGV rail links. Practical tips: speak basic French phrases,
                watch for pickpockets in tourist areas, and consider visiting in spring or autumn for milder weather and fewer
                crowds."}'
