          content: Paris is the capital city of France, located in northern central France along the River Seine. It's home
            to about 2 million residents in the city proper and some 12 million in the metropolitan area. Paris is a global
            center for art, fashion, gastronomy, and culture -- famous landmarks include the Eiffel Tower, Notre-Dame Cathedral,
            the Louvre Museum, and the Champs-Élysées. The city has a long history dating back to Roman times and played major
            roles in European politics, art, and intellectual movements. Well connected by metro, buses, regional trains,
            and two major airports (Charles de Gaulle and Orly), Paris is easy to navigate for visitors. Typical highlights
            are museum visits, café culture, river cruises on the Seine, and strolling historic neighborhoods such as the
            Marais, Saint‐Germain, and Montmartre. The best times to visit are late spring and early autumn for mild weather
            and fewer crowds.

            The city proper has roughly 2.1 million residents, with about 12 million in the greater Paris region, and is divided

            culture, finance and education. The climate is temperate oceanic (mild winters, warm summers). Practical notes:
            the Metro and RER trains make getting around easy, English is commonly understood in tourist areas but French
            is the primary language, and tourism is a major part of the economy.'
