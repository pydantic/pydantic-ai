            conditions for Paris (France),\n- Tell you where/how to get a live update on your device, or\n- Interpret a forecast
            you paste here.\n\nTypical conditions for early January in Paris (climatology / expected winter weather)\n- Average
            daytime highs: about 5-8°C (41-46°F).  \n- Average nighttime lows: about 0-3°C (32-37°F).  \n- Skies: often cloudy,
            low sun; rain is common; occasional sleet or light snow (heavy snow is uncommon).  \n- Wind: usually light to
            moderate; can feel colder with wind and dampness.  \n- Advice: warm coat, layers, waterproof shoes/umbrella.\n\nHow
            to get a live update right now\n- Ask your phone assistant (\"Hey Siri/Google, what's the weather in Paris?\"),
            or\n- Search \"Paris weather\" in Google, or check sites/apps like MeteoFrance, Weather.com, AccuWeather, or the
            BBC Weather page.\n\nIf you want, tell me which option you prefer (live lookup instructions, a 7‐day climatological
            outlook, or paste a current forecast and I'll interpret it)."
