          I received a video file (file 9964e6). The system indicates it's a video URL format that isn't directly supported for playback in this interface, so I cannot view or analyze the actual video content.

          From the technical response, I can tell that:
          - A file was successfully retrieved
          - It's identified as file 9964e6
          - It appears to be in a video format, but the specific format/codec and content cannot be processed or displayed in this environment

          If you'd like me to help with this video, you could:
          1. Describe what's in the video so I can assist you with questions about it
          2. Let me know what you'd like to do with the video (transcribe, summarize, analyze, etc.)
          3. Provide the video in a different format if possible

          Is there something specific you'd like help with regarding this video file?
