          don't have the ability to actually listen to or analyze audio content directly. \n\nWhat I received was a reference
          to an audio file, but I cannot:\n- Play the audio\n- Transcribe speech from it\n- Identify music, sounds, or voices\n-
          Analyze audio properties like pitch, tempo, or frequencies\n\nIf you'd like to know what's in this audio file, you
          could:\n1. Tell me what it contains\n2. Provide a transcript if it's speech\n3. Describe the sounds or music if
          that's what it contains\n\nIs there something specific about this audio file you'd like help with, or would you
          like to share what it contains so I can assist you further?"
