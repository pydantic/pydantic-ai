              <thinking> The tool has returned a file named "2d36ae." However, the content of the file is not supported by Bedrock, which means I cannot directly describe the audio content. I will inform the user about the file name and the limitation. </thinking>

              The tool has retrieved a file named "2d36ae." However, the content of the file is not supported by Bedrock, so I cannot describe the audio content directly. If you need specific information about the audio file, please let me know, and I'll do my best to assist you further.
