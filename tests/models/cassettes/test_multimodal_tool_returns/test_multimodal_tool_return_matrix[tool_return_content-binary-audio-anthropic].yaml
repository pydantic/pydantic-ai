          audio files - my capabilities are limited to text, images, and documents. \n\nThe file appears to be an MP3 audio
          file, which is a compressed audio format commonly used for music, podcasts, voice recordings, and other sound content.
          To know what the audio actually contains (such as speech, music, sound effects, etc.), I would need audio processing
          capabilities which I don't currently have.\n\nIf you'd like to know what's in the audio file, you could:\n- Listen
          to it yourself and describe it to me\n- Provide a transcription of any speech in the audio\n- Tell me the context
          of where this audio came from\n\nIs there anything specific about this audio file you'd like help with?"
