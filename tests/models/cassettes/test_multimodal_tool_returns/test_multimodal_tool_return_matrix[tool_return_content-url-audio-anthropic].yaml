          retrieved through the get_file tool, I cannot analyze its contents, describe what sounds are in it, or provide details
          about the audio itself (such as music, speech, tone, etc.). \n\nI can only see that:\n- It's an MP3 file\n- The
          filename suggests it's a 3-second sample\n- It came from samplelib.com (a website that provides sample files for
          testing)\n\nTo get information about what's actually in the audio, you would need to play it yourself or use a tool/service
          specifically designed for audio analysis."
