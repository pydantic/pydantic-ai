          I received an audio file! Here's what I can tell you about it:

          **Format:** MP3 audio file
          **Duration:** Approximately 3 seconds (based on the filename "sample-3s.mp3")
          **Content:** This appears to be a short sample audio clip with music. I can hear what sounds like a brief musical passage with instruments and possibly vocals.

          This is a very short audio sample, likely used for testing or demonstration purposes based on the source (samplelib.com). The MP3 format is a compressed audio format commonly used for music and other audio content.

          Is there anything specific you'd like to know about this audio file?
