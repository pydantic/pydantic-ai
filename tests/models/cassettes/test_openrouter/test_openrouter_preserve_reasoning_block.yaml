            Short answer: Very large. Voltaire's writings helped shape the core ideas of modern French culture -- especially secularism, freedom of thought and speech, skepticism toward authority, and a satirical literary tradition -- while also leaving a complicated legacy because of some of his elitist and prejudiced views.

            Key impacts

            - Political and civic ideas
              - Helped popularize Enlightenment values (reason, individual rights, criticism of absolutism) that fed into the intellectual atmosphere before the French Revolution and the republican ideals that followed. His attacks on arbitrary power and superstition influenced debates that led to reforms and to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (1789).
              - Promoted free expression and press liberties as civic goods, ideas that remain central to French public life.

            - Religion and laïcité (secularism)
              - His relentless critique of Church power and clerical abuses -- summed up in slogans like "écrasez l'infâme" ("crush the infamous thing") -- contributed to the long-term secularizing trend in France. The modern French principle of laïcité (formal separation of church and state, codified in 1905) draws on the anti-clerical Enlightenment critique in which Voltaire was a leading voice.
              - His Treatise on Tolerance (1763), written after the Calas affair, helped shift public opinion toward religious tolerance and reform of judicial abuses; his advocacy was instrumental in the campaign that led to the eventual rehabilitation of Jean Calas.

            - Legal and humanitarian influence
              - Public campaigns by Voltaire against miscarriages of justice (e.g., Calas, Sirven) helped popularize demands for fair trials, humane punishments, and legal protections -- foundations of modern human-rights discourse in France.

            - Culture, literature, and language
              - Voltaire shaped French prose style: clarity, wit, irony and satire became hallmarks of French literary sensibility. Works such as Candide (1759) remain canonical, widely read and taught, and continue to inform French humor, satire and philosophic debate.
              - He helped establish the salon and public-opinion culture that made the press and literate debate central to French political life.
              - His influence extends to later writers and thinkers who engaged with Enlightenment themes across the 19th and 20th centuries.

            - Institutions and everyday culture
              - Voltaire appears in school curricula, city toponyms (streets, squares), statues and museums (e.g., Ferney), making him a public symbol of reason and free speech.
              - Quotations and references from his works are common in political and cultural discourse in France.

            Limits and controversies
            - Voltaire was not an unambiguous liberal democrat: he favored enlightened elites and sometimes supported strong rulers (enlightened absolutism) rather than popular rule.
            - He also held and expressed prejudiced views (notably anti‐Semitic remarks in some writings), and his elitism and private behavior have prompted modern critics to nuance his legacy.
            - Modern French culture inherits both his progressive commitments (tolerance, secularism, critique of authority) and the need to critically assess the limitations of Enlightenment thought.

            Conclusion
            Voltaire's writings helped make reason, skepticism, tolerance (imperfectly), and freedom of expression central to modern French identity and institutions. He remains a foundational figure -- celebrated, taught, and debated -- whose ideas continue to shape French civic culture even as contemporary France wrestles with the contradictions in his record.

            **Summarizing Voltaire's Influence**

            I need to be concise yet thorough. I'll mention key works, such as Voltaire's "Treatise on Tolerance" from 1763 and "Candide" from 1759, and reference the Calas affair that sparked his campaign for justice. Jean Calas was executed in 1762, and Voltaire's advocacy led to the family's posthumous rehabilitation in 1765. I'll include the Declaration of the Rights of Man from 1789, which reflects Enlightenment ideals, and highlight Voltaire's catchphrase "Écrasez l'infâme." His work significantly shaped modern skepticism and rational discourse.**Discussing Voltaire's Advocacy and Legacy**

            I want to highlight Voltaire's advocacy for civil liberties, such as free trade, freedom of religion, and freedom of the press. It's important to clarify that while he supported these ideas, he wasn't a democrat and sometimes endorsed enlightened absolutism. I should include examples of his influence on modern culture, like street names, monuments, and museums (such as his home in Ferney). I'll wrap up with a balanced assessment and cite his specific works and years for clarity, keeping things concise without heavy formatting.
