            This video features a giant panda in an enclosure designed to resemble its natural habitat. The enclosure includes:
            - **Rocks and terrain:** Various sized rocks create a textured landscape.
            - **Bamboo:** Fresh bamboo shoots are scattered around, which the panda is seen eating.
            - **Background mural:** A painted mural on the back wall depicts a mountainous, green landscape, enhancing the immersive feel of the habitat.
            - **Window:** A clear window is visible in the upper part of the background, likely part of the viewing area for visitors.
            - **Enrichment toy:** A large, round, light brown object (possibly a ball or feeder) is seen on the rocks, likely an enrichment toy for the panda.
            - **Panda:** The main subject is a black and white giant panda, which is actively eating bamboo at the bottom right of the frame, occasionally looking up.
