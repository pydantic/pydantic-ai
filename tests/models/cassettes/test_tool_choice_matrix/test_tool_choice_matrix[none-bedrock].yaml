              I don't have access to real-time weather data or the ability to browse the internet, so I can't tell you the current weather in Paris.

              To get the current weather in Paris, you could:
              - Check a weather website like weather.com, weather.gov, or accuweather.com
              - Search "Paris weather" on Google or another search engine
              - Use a weather app on your phone
              - Ask a voice assistant with internet access like Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa

              Is there anything else I can help you with regarding Paris?
