            or \"this week\" and I'll give typical/seasonal expectations instead.\n\nIf you mean Paris, France, and you want
            a quick seasonal snapshot for late January:\n- Typical temperatures: daytime highs around 5-8°C (41-46°F), nighttime
            lows around 0-4°C (32-39°F).  \n- Conditions: often cloudy or overcast, frequent rain; snow is possible but not
            common.  \n- Wind: light to moderate breezes.  \n- What to wear: warm coat, layers, waterproof shoes/umbrella.\n\nTell
            me which Paris and whether you want a live update (and I'll explain how to get one) or a detailed typical forecast
            for specific days."
