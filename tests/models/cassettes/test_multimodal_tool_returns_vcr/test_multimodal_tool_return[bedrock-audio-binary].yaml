              <thinking> The get_file tool did not return any content. This could mean that the tool did not find any audio files or there was an error in the tool's execution. I should inform the user that I was unable to retrieve an audio file. </thinking>

              I'm sorry, but I was unable to retrieve an audio file using the get_file tool. Please ensure that there are audio files available for the tool to access. If the issue persists, please try again later or contact support for assistance.
