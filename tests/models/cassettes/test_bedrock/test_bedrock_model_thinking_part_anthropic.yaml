              Here are the key steps for safely crossing a street:

              **Look for a safe crossing point:**
              - Use crosswalks, pedestrian signals, or intersections when available
              - Avoid crossing mid-block or between parked cars

              **Before crossing:**
              - Stop at the curb or edge of the road
              - Look left, right, then left again
              - Listen for approaching vehicles
              - Make eye contact with drivers if possible
              - Wait for a clear gap in traffic

              **While crossing:**
              - Walk briskly but don't run
              - Stay alert and keep looking for traffic
              - Stay in the crosswalk if there is one
              - Put away phones and remove headphones
              - Be extra cautious of turning vehicles

              **Additional tips:**
              - Obey pedestrian signals (walk/don't walk signs)
              - Be extra careful at night - wear bright/reflective clothing
              - Watch for cyclists in bike lanes
              - Be patient - wait for a safe opportunity rather than rushing

              **Special situations:**
              - At stop signs: Make sure cars have completely stopped
              - In parking lots: Watch for backing vehicles
              - In bad weather: Allow extra time and be more visible

              The key is to be predictable, visible, and alert to your surroundings.

                text: The user is asking me to draw an analogy between crossing a street and crossing a river. This is an
                  interesting comparison - both involve safely getting from one side to the other, but rivers have different
                  challenges than streets. Let me think about the parallel safety considerations and methods.
          - text: |-
              Great analogy! Here's how to safely "cross the river," drawing from street-crossing principles:

              **Find a safe crossing point:**
              - Use bridges, ferries, or designated crossing areas when available
              - Look for shallow, slow-moving sections if wading
              - Avoid areas with strong currents, deep water, or obstacles

              **Before crossing:**
              - Assess the water conditions (depth, current, temperature)
              - Check weather and water levels
              - Tell someone your crossing plan
              - Ensure you have proper equipment/flotation if needed

              **Choose your crossing method:**
              - **Bridge/ferry** (like using a crosswalk) - safest option
              - **Shallow wading** (like crossing at an intersection) - wade perpendicular to current
              - **Swimming** (like jaywalking) - only if you're a strong swimmer and conditions are safe
              - **Boat** - requires proper equipment and skills

              **While crossing:**
              - Stay calm and focused
              - Move steadily but don't rush
              - Face upstream while wading to maintain balance
              - Be prepared to turn back if conditions worsen

              **Additional safety tips:**
              - Never cross during floods or storms (like not crossing in heavy traffic)
              - Wear appropriate gear (life jacket, proper footwear)
              - Cross with others when possible
              - Know your limits and abilities

              **Special considerations:**
              - Cold water requires extra precautions
              - Be aware of wildlife or underwater hazards
              - Consider tides if it's tidal water

              Just like with streets, patience and preparation are key to crossing safely!
