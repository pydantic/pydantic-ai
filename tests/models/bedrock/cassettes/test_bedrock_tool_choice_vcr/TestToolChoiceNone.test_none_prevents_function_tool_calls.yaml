              I don't have access to real-time weather information. To get the current weather in Berlin, I recommend:

              1. **Weather websites**: Check weather.com, accuweather.com, or weather.gov
              2. **Search engines**: Simply search "Berlin weather" on Google
              3. **Weather apps**: Use apps like Weather Channel, AccuWeather, or your phone's built-in weather app
              4. **Voice assistants**: Ask Siri, Google Assistant, or Alexa

              Would you like me to help you with something else about Berlin, such as typical weather patterns by season?
