# CLAI web UI README content to fold into the README later

<!-- From #10262 -->
## Web UI

Run `/web` in a session to open it in your browser: a local web app with a sessions sidebar,
streaming Markdown answers, collapsible tool calls (shell output, diffs, searches), thinking
blocks, live token counts while a turn streams, and a composer with `/` command completion, a
model picker, and a stop button. The
terminal and the browser drive the same session: a prompt typed in either runs once, and both
show it. The page follows `/theme`, and the sidebar's footer picks a theme too. `/web stop`
ends the web UI; `/web status` shows its address.

To use only the browser, start CLAI with `--web` (also `uvx pydantic-clai2 --web`). It prints
the address, opens it, and logs the conversation to the terminal until Ctrl-C.

The sidebar lists the sessions `/resume` shows, grouped by project, with search. Click one to
switch to it, or use its menu to rename, fork, or delete it; a session saved in another
directory opens read-only. Keyboard: Enter sends, Shift+Enter adds a line, Esc interrupts,
Cmd/Ctrl+K searches sessions, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+O starts a new one, Cmd/Ctrl+B hides the sidebar.

The browser can make the agent run commands, so the server listens on 127.0.0.1 only and
every request must carry a token that is new each launch; the printed link contains it. Keep
the link private. The `web` plugin starts disabled; `/web` works once it is enabled with
`/plugins enable web`, and `--web` loads it for that launch only. See
[the plugin guide](PLUGINS.md#web-this-session-in-your-browser) for settings and limits.
