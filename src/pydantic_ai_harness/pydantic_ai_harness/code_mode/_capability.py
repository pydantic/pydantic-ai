class CodeMode(AbstractCapability[AgentDepsT]):
    """Capability that exposes selected tools as callables inside a `run_code` sandbox.

    By default (`tools='all'`) every tool the agent has is wrapped behind a single
    `run_code` tool -- the model writes Python that calls them as functions instead
    of issuing tool calls directly.

    Pass a list of tool names or a callable predicate to `tools` to split the
    toolset: matching tools become callables inside the sandbox, and the rest
    stay visible to the model as normal tool calls.

    ```python
    from pydantic_ai import Agent
    from pydantic_ai_harness import CodeMode

    # Sandbox all tools
    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', capabilities=[CodeMode()])

    # Sandbox only specific tools
    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', capabilities=[CodeMode(tools=['search', 'fetch'])])
    ```

    By default, sandboxed code cannot touch the host -- no filesystem, environment
    variables, or clock. Two parameters open it up:

    - `mount` shares specific host directories: reach for it when the agent reads or
      writes real files.
    - `os_access` routes the sandbox's OS calls to a handler you provide: reach for it
      when the agent needs environment variables, the clock, or filesystem behavior you
      control.

    Both expose the real host to model-written code, so grant only what the task needs.

    ```python
    from pydantic_monty import MountDir

    agent = Agent('openai:gpt-5', capabilities=[CodeMode(mount=MountDir('/work', '/tmp/agent-work'))])
    ```

    - `Sequence[str]`: only tools whose names are listed are sandboxed.

      callable returns `True` are sandboxed; the rest stay as native tool calls.
