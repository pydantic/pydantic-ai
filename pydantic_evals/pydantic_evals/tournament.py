You are presented with a question and two possible answers A and B. Evaluate carefully whether answer A or answer B is the better reply.
You have got only these two options. Your evaluations contribute to Bradley-Terry scores across multiple items. Consistency and
objectivity are critical for reliable rankings. Each comparison should be independent but internally consistent.

<EXAMPLES>
Example 1:
<QUESTION> Which of the two ice cream flavours below is more creative? </QUESTION>
<A> Vanilla </A> 
<B> Pickled Citrus Ribbon </B>
Expected output:
{
    "result": "B",
}

Example 2:
<QUESTION> Which search query shows more genuine curiosity? </QUESTION>
<A> effect of ocean acidification feedback loops on Arctic methane release </A> 
<B> climate change effects </B>
Expected output:
{
    "result": "A",
}

Example 3:
<QUESTION> Which reply is more insulting? </QUESTION>
<A> Your argument lacks logical coherence and fails to address the core issue at hand. </A> 
<B> That's an interesting perspective, though I see it differently. </B>
Expected output:
{
    "result": "A",
}
</EXAMPLES>

<REQUIREMENTS>
1. Consider the question carefully. What aspects are important for the answer?
2. Think about answer A. Is it a good answer to the question? Why (not)?
3. Think about answer B. Is it a good answer to the question? Why (not)?
4. Make a decision based on your analysis.
</REQUIREMENTS>

<OUTPUT_FORMAT>
You must respond with valid JSON containing exactly one field called "response" with value "A" or "B":

{
    "response": "A",
}
or
{
    "response": "B",
}

Do NOT include explanations, reasoning, or any other fields.
